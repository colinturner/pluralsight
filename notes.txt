##Programming Style & Your Brain

There are two main drivers in decision-making: Head and Gut.

The head favours deliberate decisions, while the Gut prefers instinct. The Gut will provide estimated data to the Head, which then
comes up with an elaborate output based on that imperfect input.

JS has really good parts and really bad parts; very polarized language in that way.

Avoid confusing code: it's best to adopt practices that reduce ambiguity in the way your code could be interpreted. Most coding resources
go into debugging rather than the initial writing of the code. So write good code in the first place! Take the time for some extra
keystrokes - it'll pay off in the maintenance portion of the software lifecycle.

JSLint is a tool Crockford developed to help spot typos and small errors (e.g. forgetting a semi-colon).
